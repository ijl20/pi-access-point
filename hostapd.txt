FIXED !

The instructions from 
www.umpah.net/raspberry-pi-as-standalon ... omment-172 work 
with a couple of provisos :
(1) My mistake was not to run in Step 2 the command sudo rpi-update. When I saw 
the warning message "..... only do this if instructed to by an engineer .." I 
opted not to continue. The result was that I got the error message described in 
this post when I went to install HOSTAPD. On my second pass through the 
www.umpah.net procedure I did continue with rpi-update with the result that when 
I came to install HOSTAPD it went without incident.

(2) For the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to get the www.umpah.net procedure to work 
properly there are a couple of small corrections to make
(a) In Step 3 there is a missing line in the /etc/network/interfaces file. It 
needs a new line between 10 and 11 that reads
auto wlan0
(b)In Step 5 the hostapd.conf file should have the driver line (line 3) 
commented out viz. #driver=nl80211

(3) to complete the setup with Apache and PHP you need to install these with the 
following commands

sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo chown -R pi:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chown -R 770 /var/www/html/
sudo apt install php php-mbstring

The last line installs PHP Version 7

Restart everything before checking it is all running ....
If you run ifconfig you should see the IP address of wlan0 is indeed 10.0.0.1

If you turn wifi on on your cell phone then you should see an available wifi 
called raspberrypi which you can connect to by using the password raspberry.
Once connected open Google Chrome on your phone and type in 10.0.0.1/index.html 
and you should get the Apache 2 Debian Default Page screen.

To check that PHP7 is running you need to write a little php file on the 
Raspberry Pi. This is most easliy done by using this in the terminal ...

echo "<?php phpinfo ();?>" > /var/www/html/index.php

Now when you type in 10.0.0.1/index.php into your cell phone's browser you 
should see the PHP version page ... someting like this "PHP Version 
7.0.0.33-0+deb9u3

From now on you can build your website on the Raspberry Pi by putting all the 
files into /var/www/html/ and its sub-directories.
